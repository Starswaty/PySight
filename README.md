## About the Workshop
Skillsprint: Pysight is a 5-day workshop organized by [Your Technical Club Name]. The workshop aimed to provide participants with a deep dive into computer vision concepts and applications using OpenCV and Python. Through interactive sessions, practical examples, and hands-on projects, attendees gained a solid foundation in computer vision, enabling them to tackle real-world problems.

## Projects

### Project 1: Image Processing with OpenCV
In this project, participants explored the fundamentals of image processing with OpenCV. They delved into various techniques, including filtering, color manipulation, and transformations. This project served as a hands-on introduction to the powerful capabilities of OpenCV in manipulating and enhancing digital images.

### Project 2: Object Detection
The second project focused on the exciting field of object detection. Participants learned to apply advanced computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize objects in both images and videos. This project laid the groundwork for understanding the principles behind object detection, a crucial aspect of many computer vision applications.

### Bonus Project: Your Own Computer Vision Project
As a bonus assignment, participants were encouraged to unleash their creativity and propose their own computer vision project. This open-ended challenge allowed them to apply the skills acquired during the workshop to real-world scenarios, fostering innovation and independent problem-solving.
